### Notes

#### March

##### Can containers escape?

* `cgroups`, controlled by `cgroupfs`, provide means to limit/account/isolate the resource usage of a set of processes.
   * further divided into subsystems, each responsible for a specific resource (e.g memory cgroup, device cgroup, etc)
      * any further nested are new cgroups under that subsystem
* `cat /proc/self/cgroup` shows cgroup membership
* Arbitrary binaries (run with highest possible, root, permissions) can be ran by the termination of a proc in a cgroup if there has been a binary assigned to the subsystem's `release_agent`, and the child process has `notify_on_release` enabled.
   * This is OK, if the system was checking that the child proc had the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` perms to run it first. _It was not_.
   * Writing to `notify_on_release` still requires `root` within the container.
* cgroups are RO mounts inside containers (`mount | grep "cgroup (ro"`)
* Utility helper/checker function: [Palo Alto Networks - can container escape][4]
